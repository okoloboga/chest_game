                  Now you are a real pirate☠

                  Yo-ho-ho! It's all very simple:
                  1. Make a deposit in TON.
                  2. Guess or hide the treasure chest.
                  3. Withdraw the prize to your wallet without restrictions (any wallet that supports TON).

                  No cheating or tricks:
                  1. Players: 2 (random player or your friend cabin boy)
                  2. Chests: 3 (1 winning)
                  3. Roles: One hides, the other searches (it's a matter of luck, the bot determines)
                  4. Prize: The one who did the best job with the role
                  5. Time per move: 1 minute

                  ⚠️ But remember:
                  1. Minimum deposit: 0.5 TON
                  2. Winning coefficient: from 1.55X (invite friends, and it will grow)
                  3. PRIZE = Deposit X Winning coefficient (withdraw at any time, any amount - no limits.)

                  Invite friends, earn from their wins and losses, increase your winning coefficient.
